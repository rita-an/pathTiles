##Generating Patterns from GPS-Data

This web-based pattern Generator uses .gpx files containing any kind of routes, tracks or places to create unique patterns.

It turns our experiences and memories, which are allways connected to a place or a journey, into a visual pattern that can be materialized in the physical world through a knitted textile.

The generated patterns are based on a 24x40 rapport whith two colors, so the resulting .jpg image can be easily programmed into a knitting machnine.

## Notes for Use

Currently it only works with the .gpx file format.
There are free online resources to generate .gpx files or convert other GPS-Data formats into the .gpx file-format. 

At the moment the saving of the image works with Firefox and Chrome Browser but not with the Safari Browser.
